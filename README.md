Demo images for LearnSphere

Files:
- hero-1.png — top-left hero screenshot (wide)
- hero-2.png — alternative hero screenshot (wide)
- hero-3.png — study tools accessibility screenshot (wide)

These files are placeholders copied from the user's attachments. Replace them with the original PNGs if you want higher fidelity.

How to replace:
1. Put the real images into `public/demo/` with the same filenames.
2. Commit the changes: git add public/demo/* && git commit -m "Add demo screenshots".

Notes:
- The images are intentionally added to `public/` so they are served statically at `/demo/<filename>` in development.
- If you prefer a different folder, move them and update references accordingly.
